In the following exercise we will read dates from the csv file.
Please take a look at the `parse_date` paramter of `pd.read_csv` and use it.
We will work on the sample database *snldb*.

1.     compute the sketches of the season with year 1978
2.     compute the sketches of the seasons with year 1978-1982
2.     compute the sketches aired in 1978 (consider the table `snl_episode.csv`)
3.     for each season, compute the average rating (consider only top
       1000 users)
4.     for each season, compute the difference between the maximum and
       the minimum ratings.
