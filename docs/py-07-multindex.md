We will work on the dataset [snldb](https://github.com/gdv/foundationsCS-2018/blob/master/ex-data/snldb), where you can find data on a TV show.
Each episode of the show consists of one (or more) parts.

1.    read the data in `snl_title.csv`
2.     remove all rows that do not have a title
3.     Build a DataFrame with index the pair (season id, episode id).
3.     Extract the sketches of seasons 3 and 4.
