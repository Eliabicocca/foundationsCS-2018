    "| Character | Meaning |\n",
    "|:--- | :--- |\n",
    "| ^ | Beginning of line |\n",
    "| $ | End of line |\n",
    "| * | Match 0+ times the previous character in RE |\n",
    "| + | Match 1+ times the previous character in RE |\n",
    "| ? | Match 0 or 1 times the previous character in RE |\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to match any of the character in the previous table by \"escaping\" it using `\\`.  For example, `\\+` matches the character `+`.\n",
    "To group multiple characters just write them the correct sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, characters `[` and `]` are used to group together other characters in a character class.\n",
    "For example `[abcd]` means *\"any character between a, b, c and d\"*.\n",
    "`[abcd]` and `[a-d]` are the same character class.\n",
    "\n",
    "To match multiple patterns, group all the patterns between parentheses, and divide them using `|`.\n",
    "For example `(ab|ca|de)` matches `ab`, `ca`, and `de`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `^` is inside a character class, it complements the elements inside the class.  This means that `[^a-d]` means *\"any character that is not a, b, c, nor d.\n",
